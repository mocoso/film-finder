  <h1>Find a film <small>to watch online in the UK</small></h1>

  <p>
    I have retired this service because there are now other, more comprehensive
    and much better supported services for finding films to stream in the UK.

  <p>
    We recommend <a href='https://www.justwatch.com/uk'>JustWatch</a> which
    offers a more comprehensive search service for films to stream in the UK.
